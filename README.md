# Optimized Sieve of Erathostenes
Optimized Sieve of Erathostenes Algorithm to find Prime Numbers
in O(n) time complexity



## Description

In mathematics, Sieve of Eratosthenes is 
an old algorithm for finding all prime 
numbers up to any limit.

The Manipulated Eratosthenes Algorithm works as follows:

- For each number i where i ranges from 2 to N-1: Check if the number is prime. If the number is prime, store it in the prime array. 
- For every prime numbers j less than or equal to the smallest prime factor p of i: Mark all numbers as j*p non-prime. Mark the smallest prime factor of j*p as j.

## Requirements
- Any Text Editor (VSCode , Atom , DEV-C++, XCode)  
- GCC Compiler
## How to Run

Run the commands below on the Path where the File is saved.
